Alohi Word Chain Game

Things that I would normally do but did not have time:
- Pull out repeated code into functions, namely the checks for user and game.
- Add better handling for when the server is unable to find a word before timeout.
- structure the code better, all functions interacting with DB should be in a controller module.
